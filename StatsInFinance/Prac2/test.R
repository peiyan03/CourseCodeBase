#Consider the price of 1 share of stock TSAEZ
#What do we expect it to be?
#Without any info we expect it to be a (strictly) positive number.
#If we know today's price of 1 share of stock to be
today=113
#what do we expect tomorrow's price to be?
#We expect tomorrow's price to be around 113.

#If we believe the following 100 values are possible for tomorrow's price of stock
x=rnorm(100,100,10)
plot(x,type="p")
#what do we expect tomorrow's price to be?
#Answer:Take the average:
mean(x)
abline(h=mean(x))
points(0,113,pch=19,cex=2,col="red")

#Incidently, a summary of these values can be obtained as
summary(x)

#So 113 is one of the possible values, but it is rare. 
#It is more likely to get values around 100.
# A measure of how far away are the values spread around the mean is
#given by variance
var(x)
#and standard deviation=square root of variance
sd(x)

#Mean, variance and standard deviation are all statistical characteristics
#of the random variable (function) that gives possible value of stock price.
#The best statistical characteristic is the distribution. If we know it, 
#we can compute all the other ones: mean, variance, sd

# In this case we assumed normal distribution
#Empirical distribution
h=hist(x,main="Empirical vs theoretical distribution",col="gray")
par(ask=T)
#vs theoretical distribution
xfit=seq(min(x),max(x),length=40)
yfit<-dnorm(xfit,mean=mean(x),sd=sd(x))
yfit <- yfit*diff(h$mids[1:2])*length(x)
lines(xfit, yfit, col="blue", lwd=2) 
par(ask=T)
abline(v=mean(x),col="green",lwd=3)

#All this was about the price tomorrow. But tomorrow is a single point in time.
#What if we want to follow the evolution of the stock price over a year?
#(i.e. 252 trading days). For each day we have a (closing) price that can 
#follow a distribution (like normal). 

# For each moment of time we have a random variable. We have seen the 
# empirical distribution (coming from data) and the theoretical distribution
# (coming from our beliefs, which are embodied in a model, like the normal 
#distribution)

#What model should we believe for the data? For sure it must be a stochastic
#process, because that's the only think we know (time series).

#Consider a plot of each stock price vs yesterday's price
#In some cases there is a dependency, which sometimes is even linear.

#Method to find the (best-fit) line equation: least squares.

#So for linear dependency we can write X(t+1)=aX(t)+b and we get a (linear)
#model that approximates the data. For this linear model we can easier study 
#the statistical characteristics and use it for forecasting.
